### Current Number of APIs: 31

<p>Here I have a collection of APIs which I made overtime for my differet projects. I noticed that some APIs are required in all the projects and some functions are also repetitive!</p>
<br/>
<p>Thus to make my task easy and efficient I combined all the APIs and have have created ifferet functions that are used to reduce code duplicates and also helps in making new APIs faster and easier!</p>
<br/>
<p>Please feel free to use the APIs(For Testing Purpose only) in your Projects. Also if you find any bug(*new feature :)*) , create a pull request or reach out to me! It you want to create your Own APIs and want to combine it here please feel free to contact me!</p>
<p>Also I am constantly working on Improving my work! If you find some areas that can be improved then please create an issue</p>
